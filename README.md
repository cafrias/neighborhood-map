# Neighborhood Map Application

## Introduction

This application is part of Udacity's Front-end Nanodegree. And it's made based on this [rubric](www.add-site.com).

## Getting Started

[//]: # (TODO: Add instalation guide)

To start developing, first run tests issuing the following command:

``` 
npm run devtest
```

Then, start devServer running, on another terminal instance, the following:

```
npm run dev
```

Open two tabs on the browser:

- One at localhost:8080. Running the application.
- Another at localhost:8090. Running the tests.

Both are _inlined_, meaning that they will get reloaded if there's a change on any JS file.
